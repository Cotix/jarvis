# jarvis
Jarvis is a service monitoring system. There is ofcourse a wide range of choice in monitoring systems already,
but most are overly convoluted. Jarvis aims to be flexible and as simple as possible, giving a lot of control to the user.
Minimal configuration needed to get up and running, and maximum control over what and how you want to check your services.
Jarvis is modular in its checking, but also in its reporting, making it easy to add different update consumers.
The ultimate goal is to make a simple monitoring system you can wrap your head around in an afternoon, all batteries included,
no weird database dependencies or kafka streams to deal with.
